1, add an example to 4.2, 4.3 (Done)

2, write the section 6, connection between patterns and execution models, may includes an simplified cost model which contains a few equations for swi or swi+channel. (Done)

when swi is compute-bound, then it should switch to swi+channel for more computing parallelism.  (Done)

3, cut some staff in section 2 and add the related work there.  (Done)

4, Specify the prediction is from direct prediction or potential evolution..
