Zeke:
1, add an example to 4.2, 4.3
2, write the section 6, connection between patterns and execution models, may includes an simplified cost model which contains a few equations for swi or swi+channel.
when swi is compute-bound, then it should switch to swi+channel for more computing parallelism. 
3, cut some staff in section 2 and add the related work there.
