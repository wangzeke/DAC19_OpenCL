\section{Conclusion}
Hello Conclusion. 

Take-away messages:

1, Direct adoption of OpenCL does not work well on FPGA. It does not take advantage of FPGA properties. 

2, The necessary background of FPGA is required to guarantee the good performance of OpenCL kernels on FPGAs. 

3, for the beginner, OpenCL is much easier than RTL . 

Two observations are orthogonal. 

1, Multi-pass and atomic operations can benefit from single-work item.

2, Multiple kernels (producer-consumer) can benefit from channel. 

3, NDRange can explore more pipelined parallelism than single-work-item. (Using one example (MM) to show).
